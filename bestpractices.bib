abstract = {Distance distributions between paramagnetic centers in the range of 1.8 to 6 nm in membrane proteins and up to 10 nm in deuterated soluble proteins can be measured by the DEER technique. The number of paramagnetic centers and their relative orientation can be characterized. DEER does not require crystallization and is not limited with respect to the size of the protein or protein complex. Diamagnetic proteins are accessible by site-directed spin labeling. To characterize structure or structural changes, experimental protocols were optimized and techniques for artifact suppression were introduced. Data analysis programs were developed, and it was realized that interpretation of the distance distributions must take into account the conformational distribution of spin labels. First methods have appeared for deriving structural models from a small number of distance constraints. The present scope and limitations of the technique are illustrated.},

abstract = {An all-atomistic force field (FF) has been developed for fully saturated phospholipids. The parametrization has been largely based on high-level ab initio calculations in order to keep the empirical input to a minimum. Parameters for the lipid chains have been developed based on knowledge about bulk alkane liquids, for which thermodynamic and dynamic data are excellently reproduced. The FFs ability to simulate lipid bilayers in the liquid crystalline phase in a tensionless ensemble was tested in simulations of three lipids: 1,2-diauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phospocholine (DLPC), 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC), and 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospcholine (DPPC). Computed areas and volumes per lipid, and three different kinds of bilayer thicknesses, have been investigated. Most importantly NMR order parameters and scattering form factors agree in an excellent manner with experimental data under a range of temperatures. Further, the compatibility with the AMBER FF for biomolecules as well as the ability to simulate bilayers in gel phase was demonstrated. Overall, the FF presented here provides the important balance between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic forces present in lipid bilayers and therefore can be used for more complicated studies of realistic biological membranes with protein insertions.},

For this purpose, the Lennard-Jones parameters of the hydrocarbon chains were adjusted by simulating a system consisting of 128 pentadecane molecules and varying the Lennard-Jones parameters until the experimental density and heat of vaporization were obtained. With these parameters the lipid density resulted in perfect agreement with the experimental density.

abstract = {Long-wavelength thermal fluctuations of lipid membranes are adequately described by the Helfrich elastic model. On the other hand, fluctuations of wavelengths comparable with bilayer thickness exhibit significant deviations from the prediction of the elastic model and are typically assumed to be dominated by microscopic surface tension due to protrusion of lipid molecules into the solvent. We present evidence that the short-wavelength modes of a lipid membrane are dominated by fluctuations of the tilt of lipid molecules with respect to the membrane normal rather than the microscopic surface tension. We obtain an expression for the spectral intensity of the thermal membrane fluctuations by appealing to the Hamm-Kozlov model, which accounts for both membrane bending and lipid tilt contributions to the total membrane energy but neglects the contributions of the microscopic surface tension. The tilt and the bending fluctuations obtained from our coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of a dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine lipid bilayer show good agreement with the theory. Furthermore, the obtained tilt and bending moduli are in close agreement with experimentally determined values. The magnitude of the microscopic protrusion tension estimated from our simulations is significantly smaller than that of the tilt modulus. These results indicate that the membrane fluctuations can be adequately described by a macroscopic elastic model down to scales of interlipid distance provided one accounts for the tilt fluctuations.},

The starting point in our geometric derivation is the Doyle–Ericksen formula, which states that the Cauchy stress tensor is the derivative of the free-energy with respect to the ambient metric tensor and which follows from a covariance argument. Thus, our approach to define the microscopic stress tensor does not rely on the statement of balance of linear momentum as in the classical Irving–Kirkwood–Noll approach. Nevertheless, the resulting stress tensor satisfies balance of linear and angular momentum. Furthermore, our approach removes the ambiguity in the definition of the microscopic stress in the presence of multibody interactions by naturally suggesting a canonical and physically motivated force decomposition into pairwise terms, a key ingredient in this theory. As a result, our approach provides objective expressions to compute a microscopic stress for a system in equilibrium and for force-fields expanded into multibody interactions of arbitrarily high order. We illustrate the proposed methodology with molecular dynamics simulations of a fibrous protein using a force-field involving up to 5-body interactions.},

@article{Ramakrishnan2014c,
abstract = {Biological membranes constitute boundaries of cells and cell organelles. These membranes are soft fluid interfaces whose thermodynamic states are dictated by bending moduli, induced curvature fields, and thermal fluctuations. Recently, there has been a flood of experimental evidence highlighting active roles for these structures in many cellular processes ranging from trafficking of cargo to cell motility. It is believed that the local membrane curvature, which is continuously altered due to its interactions with myriad proteins and other macromolecules attached to its surface, holds the key to the emergent functionality in these cellular processes. Mechanisms at the atomic scale are dictated by protein-lipid interaction strength, lipid composition, lipid distribution in the vicinity of the protein, shape and amino acid composition of the protein, and its amino acid contents. The specificity of molecular interactions together with the cooperativity of multiple proteins induce and stabilize complex membrane shapes at the mesoscale. These shapes span a wide spectrum ranging from the spherical plasma membrane to the complex cisternae of the Golgi apparatus. Mapping the relation between the protein-induced deformations at the molecular scale and the resulting mesoscale morphologies is key to bridging cellular experiments across various length scales. In this review, we focus on the theoretical and computational methods used to understand the phenomenology underlying protein-driven membrane remodeling. Interactions at the molecular scale can be computationally probed by all atom and coarse grained molecular dynamics (MD, CGMD), as well as dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations, which we only describe in passing. We choose to focus on several continuum approaches extending the Canham-Helfrich elastic energy model for membranes to include the effect of curvature-inducing proteins and explore the conformational phase space of such systems. In this description, the protein is expressed in the form of a spontaneous curvature field. The approaches include field theoretical methods limited to the small deformation regime, triangulated surfaces and particle-based computational models to investigate the large-deformation regimes observed in the natural state of many biological membranes. Applications of these methods to understand the properties of biological membranes in homogeneous and inhomogeneous environments of proteins, whose underlying curvature fields are either isotropic or anisotropic, are discussed. The diversity in the curvature fields elicits a rich variety of morphological states, including tubes, discs, branched tubes, and caveola. Mapping the thermodynamic stability of these states as a function of tuning parameters such as concentration and strength of curvature induction of the proteins is discussed. The relative stabilities of these self-organized shapes are examined through free-energy calculations. The suite of methods discussed here can be tailored to applications in specific cellular settings such as endocytosis during cargo trafficking and tubulation of filopodial structures in migrating cells, which makes these methods a powerful complement to experimental studies. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {For molecular dynamics simulations of biological membrane systems to live up to the potential of providing accurate atomic level detail into membrane properties and functions, it is essential that the force fields used to model such systems are as accurate as possible. One membrane property that is often used to assess force field accuracy is the carbon-hydrogen (or carbon-deuterium) order parameters of the lipid tails, which can be accurately measured using experimental NMR techniques. There are a variety of analysis tools available to calculate these order parameters from simulations and it is essential that these computational tools work correctly to ensure the accurate assessment of the simulation force fields. In this work we compare many of these computational tools for calculating the order parameters of POPC membranes. While tools that work on all-atom systems and tools that work on saturated lipid tails in general work extremely well, we demonstrate that the majority of the tested tools that calculate the order parameters for unsaturated united-atom lipid tails do so incorrectly. We identify tools that do perform accurate calculations and include one such program with this work, enabling rapid and accurate calculation of united-atom lipid order parameters. Furthermore, we discuss cases in which it is non-trivial to appropriately predict the unsaturated carbon order parameters in united-atom systems. Finally, we examine order parameter splitting for carbon 2 in sn-2 lipid chains, demonstrating substantial deviations from experimental values in several all-atom and united-atom lipid force fields.},

The Dry Martini force field reproduces relatively well a variety of lipid membrane properties such as area per lipid, bilayer thickness, bending modulus, and coexistence of liquid-ordered and disordered domains. Furthermore, we show that the new model can be applied to study membrane fusion and tether formation, with results similar to those of the standard Martini model.

abstract = {Biological cell membranes are responsible for a range of structural and dynamical phenomena crucial, which are crucial to a cell's well-being and its associated functions. Due to the complexity of cell membranes, lipid bilayer systems are often used as biomimetic models. These systems have led to significant insights into vital membrane phenomena such as domain formation, passive permeation, and protein insertion. Experimental observations of membrane structure and dynamics are, however, limited in resolution, both spatial and temporal. Importantly, computer simulations are starting to play a more prominent role in interpreting experimental results, enabling a molecular understanding of lipid membranes. In particular, the synergy between scattering experiments and simulations offers opportunities for new discoveries in membrane physics, as the length and time scales probed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations parallel those of experiments. Here, we describe a coarse-grained MD simulation approach that mimics neutron scattering data from large unilamellar lipid vesicles over a range of bilayer rigidities. Specifically, we simulate vesicle form factors and membrane thickness fluctuations determined from small angle neutron scattering (SANS) and neutron spin echo (NSE) experiments, respectively. Our simulations accurately reproduce trends from experiments and lay the groundwork for studies of more complex membrane systems.},

From the analysis of a 0.1 micros MD trajectory, we find that the time evolution of the mean-square displacement, {\textless}[deltar(t)]2{\textgreater}, of lipid atoms and molecules exhibits three well-separated dynamical regions: (i) ballistic, with {\textless}[deltar(t)]2{\textgreater} approximately t2 for t{\textless}or approximately 10 fs; (ii) subdiffusive, with {\textless}[deltar(t)]2{\textgreater} approximately tbeta with beta{\textless}1 for 10 ps{\textless}or approximately t{\textless}or approximately 10 ns; and (iii) Fickian diffusion, with {\textless}[deltar(t)]2{\textgreater} approximately t for t{\textgreater}or approximately 30 ns. We propose a memory-function approach for calculating {\textless}[deltar(t)]2{\textgreater} over the entire time range extending from the ballistic to the Fickian diffusion regimes. The results are in very good agreement with the ones from the MD simulations. We also examine the implications of the presence of the subdiffusive dynamics of lipids on the self-intermediate scattering function and the incoherent dynamic structure factor measured in neutron-scattering experiments.},

The first and main section of the review is concerned with the bilayer–water interface and is divided into four subsections. The first describes the simplest case, where the interface consists only of lipid head groups and water molecules and focuses on interactions between the lipid heads and water molecules; the second describes the interface containing also mono- and divalent ions and concentrates on lipid-ion interactions; the third describes direct inter-lipid interactions. These three subsections are followed by a discussion on the network of direct and indirect inter-lipid interactions at the bilayer interface. The second section summarises recent computer simulation studies on the interactions of antibacterial membrane active compounds with various models of the bacterial outer membrane.

@article{Wohlert2006,
abstract = {Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of a lipid bilayer were performed to calculate the free energy of a trans-membrane pore as a function of its radius. The free energy was calculated as a function of a reaction coordinate using a potential of mean constraint force. The pore radius was then calculated from the reaction coordinate using Monte Carlo particle insertions. The main characteristics of the free energy that comes out of the simulations are a quadratic shape for a radius less than about 0.3 nm, a linear shape for larger radii than this, and a rather abrupt change without local minima or maxima between the two regions. In the outer region, a line tension can be calculated, which is consistent with the experimentally measured values. Further, this line tension can be rationalized and understood in terms of the energetic cost for deforming a part of the lipid bilayer into a hydrophilic pore. The region with small radii can be described and understood in terms of statistical mechanics of density fluctuations. In the region of crossover between a quadratic and linear free energy there was some hysteresis associated with filling and evacuation of the pore with water. The metastable prepore state hypothesized to interpret the experiments was not observed in this region.},

The energetics of the surface, in turn, govern the formation of membrane structures and membrane reshaping processes, and thus they will underlie cellular-scale models of viral fusion, vesicle-dependent transport, and lateral organization relevant to signaling. The spontaneous curvature, to the best of our knowledge, is always assumed to be additive. We describe observations from simulations of unexpected nonadditive compositional curvature energetics of two lipids essential to the plasma membrane: sphingomyelin and cholesterol. A model is developed that connects molecular interactions to curvature stress, and which explains the role of local composition. Cholesterol is shown to lower the number of effective Kuhn segments of saturated acyl chains, reducing lateral pressure below the neutral surface of bending and favoring positive curvature. The effect is not observed for unsaturated (flexible) acyl chains. Likewise, hydrogen bonding between sphingomyelin lipids leads to positive curvature, but only at sufficient concentration, below which the lipid prefers negative curvature.},

In this work, we further examine the accuracy of C36FF over a wide temperature range for a broader range of lipid types such as various head groups (phosphatidic acid (PA), PC, phosphoethanolamine (PE), phosphoglycerol (PG), and phosphoserine (PS)), and tails (saturated, mono-, mixed- and poly-unsaturated acyl chains with varied chain lengths). The structural properties (surface area per lipid (SA/lip), overall bilayer thickness, hydrophobic thickness, headgroup-to-headgroup thickness, deuterium order parameter (SCD), and spin-lattice relaxation time (T1)) obtained from simulations agree well with nearly all available experimental data. Our analyses indicate that PS lipids have the most inter-lipid hydrogen bonds, while PG lipids have the most intra-lipid hydrogen bonds, which play the main role in their low SA/lip in PS lipids and low thicknesses in PG lipids, respectively. PS, PE, and PA lipids have the largest contact clusters with on average 5–8 lipids per cluster, while PC and PG have clusters of 4 lipids based on a cutoff distance of 6.5 {\AA}. PS lipids have much slower lipid wobble (i.e., higher correlation time) than other head groups at a given temperature as the hydrogen bonded network significantly reduces a lipid's mobility, and the rate of lipid wobble increases dramatically as temperature increases. These in-depth analyses facilitate further understanding of lipid bilayers at the atomic level.},

We carried out microsecond-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of large vesicles, highlighting the ability of the model to study systems at mesoscopic length and time scales.

abstract = {A new approach is presented for obtaining coarse-grained (CG) force fields from fully atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories. The method is demonstrated by applying it to derive a CG model for the dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) lipid bilayer. The coarse-graining of the interparticle force field is accomplished by an application of a force-matching procedure to the force data obtained from an explicit atomistic MD simulation of the biomolecular system of interest. Hence, the method is termed a "multiscale" CG (MS-CG) approach in which explicit atomistic-level forces are propagated upward in scale to the coarse-grained level. The CG sites in the lipid bilayer application were associated with the centers-of-mass of atomic groups because of the simplicity in the evaluation of the forces acting on them from the atomistic data. The resulting CG lipid bilayer model is shown to accurately reproduce the structural properties of the phospholipid bilayer.},

abstract = {We study the system-size dependence of translational diffusion coefficients and viscosities in molecular dynamics simulations under periodic boundary conditions. Simulations of water under ambient conditions and a Lennard-Jones (LJ) fluid show that the diffusion coefficients increase strongly as the system size increases. We test a simple analytic correction for the system-size effects that is based on hydrodynamic arguments. This correction scales as N-1/3, where N is the number of particles. For a cubic simulation box of length L, the diffusion coefficient corrected for system-size effects is D-0 = D-PBC + 2.837297k(B)T/(6.7pietaL), where D-PBC is the diffusion coefficient calculated in the simulation, k(B) the Boltzmann constant, T the absolute temperature, and eta the shear viscosity of the solvent. For water, LJ fluids, and hard-sphere fluids, this correction quantitatively accounts for the system-size dependence of the calculated self-diffusion coefficients. In contrast to diffusion coefficients, the shear viscosities of water and the LJ fluid show no significant system-size dependences.},

abstract = {This paper describes the parametrization of a new coarse grained (CG) model for lipid and surfactant systems. Reduction of the number of degrees of freedom together with the use of short range potentials makes it computationally very efficient. Compared to atomistic models a gain of 3-4 orders of magnitude can be achieved. Micrometer length scales or millisecond time scales are therefore within reach. To encourage applications, the model is kept very simple. Only a small number of coarse grained atom types are defined, which interact using a few discrete levels of interaction. Despite the computational speed and the simplistic nature of the model, it proves to be both versatile in its applications and accurate in its predictions. We show that densities of liquid alkanes from decane up to eicosane can be reproduced to within 5{\%}, and the mutual solubilities of alkanes in water and water in alkanes can be reproduced within 0.5 kT of the experimental values. The CG model for dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) is shown to aggregate spontaneously into a bilayer. Structural properties such as the area per headgroup and the phosphate-phosphate distance match the experimentally measured quantities closely. The same is true for elastic properties such as the bending modulus and the area compressibility, and dynamic properties such as the lipid lateral diffusion coefficient and the water permeation rate. The distribution of the individual lipid components along the bilayer normal is very similar to distributions obtained from atomistic simulations. Phospholipids with different headgroup (ethanolamine) or different tail lengths (lauroyl, stearoyl) or unsaturated tails (oleoyl) can also be modeled with the CG force field. The experimental area per headgroup can be reproduced for most lipids within 0.02 nm2. Finally, the CG model is applied to nonbilayer phases. Dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) aggregates into small micelles that are structurally very similar to ones modeled atomistically, and DOPE forms an inverted hexagonal phase with structural parameters in agreement with experimental data.},

abstract = {Phospholipids are essential building blocks of biological membranes. Despite of vast amount of very accurate experimental data, the atomistic resolution structures sampled by the glycerol backbone and choline headgroup in phoshatidylcholine bilayers are not known. Atomistic resolution molecular dynamics simulations have the potential to resolve the structures, and to give an arrestingly intuitive interpretation of the experimental data - but only if the simulations reproduce the data within experimental accuracy. In the present work, we simulated phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid bilayers with 13 different atomistic models, and compared simulations with NMR experiments in terms of the highly structurally sensitive C-H bond vector order parameters. Focusing on the glycerol backbone and choline headgroups, we showed that the order parameter comparison can be used to judge the atomistic resolution structural accuracy of the models. Accurate models, in turn, allow molecular dynamics simulations to be used as an interpretation tool that translates these NMR data into a dynamic three dimensional representation of biomolecules in biologically relevant conditions. In addition to lipid bilayers in fully hydrated conditions, we reviewed previous experimental data for dehydrated bilayers and cholesterol-containing bilayers, and interpreted them with simulations. Although none of the existing models reached experimental accuracy, by critically comparing them we were able to distill relevant chemical information: (1) increase of choline order parameters indicates the P-N vector tilting more parallel to the membrane, and (2) cholesterol induces only minor changes to the PC (glycerol backbone) structure. This work has been done as a fully open collaboration, using nmrlipids.blogspot.fi as a communication platform; all the scientific contributions were made publicly on this blog. During the open research process, the repository holding our simulation trajectories and files (https://zenodo.org/collection/user-nmrlipids) has become the most extensive publicly available collection of molecular dynamics simulation trajectories of lipid bilayers.},

@article{Siegel2008,
abstract = {The Gaussian curvature elastic energy contribution to the energy of membrane fusion intermediates has usually been neglected because the Gaussian curvature elastic modulus, $\kappa$, was unknown. It is now possible to measure $\kappa$ for phospholipids that form bicontinuous inverted cubic (QII) phases. Here, it is shown that one can estimate $\kappa$ for lipids that do not form QIIphases by studying the phase behavior of lipid mixtures. The method is used to estimate $\kappa$ for several lipid compositions in excess water. The values of $\kappa$ are used to compute the curvature elastic energies of stalks and catenoidal fusion pores according to recent models. The Gaussian curvature elastic contribution is positive and similar in magnitude to the bending energy contribution: it increases the total curvature energy of all the fusion intermediates by 100 units of kBT or more. It is important to note that this contribution makes the predicted intermediate energies compatible with observed lipid phase behavior in excess water. An order-of-magnitude fusion rate equation is used to estimate whether the predicted stalk energies are consistent with the observed rates of stalk-mediated processes in pure lipid systems. The current theory predicts a stalk energy that is slightly too large, by ∼30 kBT, to rationalize the observed rates of stalk-mediated processes in phosphatidylethanolamine or N-monomethylated dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine systems. Despite this discrepancy, the results show that models of fusion intermediate energy are accurate enough to make semiquantitative predictions about how proteins mediate biomembrane fusion. The same rate model shows that for proteins to drive biomembrane fusion at observed rates, they have to perform mediating functions corresponding to a reduction in the energy of a purely lipidic stalk by several tens of kBT. By binding particular peptide sequences to the monolayer surface, proteins could lower fusion intermediate energies by altering the elastic constants of the patches of lipid monolayer that form the stalk. Here, it is shown that if peptide binding changes $\kappa$ or some other combinations of local elastic constants by only tens of percents, the stalk energy and the energy of catenoidal fusion pores would decrease by tens of kBT relative to the pure lipid value. This is comparable to the required mediating effect. The curvature energies of stalks and catenoidal fusion pores have almost the same dependence on monolayer elastic constants as the curvature energies of the rhombohedral and QIIphases; respectively. The effects of isolated fusion-relevant peptides on the energies of these intermediates can be determined by studying the effects of the peptides on the stability of rhombohedral and QIIphases. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Biophysical Society.},

In the model, 14 coarse-grained sites that are classified as 1 of 6 types represent DPPC.

A key focus of this work is to quantify the structure of the P$\beta$phase for DMPC and compare with measures from x-ray experiments. The P$\beta$major arm has similar structure to that of the L$\beta$, while the thinner minor arm has interdigitated chains and the transition region between these two regions has large chain splay and disorder. At lower temperatures, our MD simulations predict the formation of the L$\beta$phase with tilted fatty acid chains. The P$\beta$and L$\beta$phases are studied for mixtures of DMPC and DPPC and compare favorably with experiment. Overall, our MD simulations provide evidence for the relevancy of the CHARMM36 lipid force field for structures and add to our understanding of the less-defined P$\beta$phase.},

abstract = {Tilt of hydrocarbon chains of lipid molecules with respect to membrane plane is commonly con- sidered to characterize the internal structure of a membrane in the crystalline state. However, membranes in the liquid state can also exhibit tilt resulting from packing constraints imposed on the lipid molecules in diverse biologically relevant structures such as intermediates of membrane fusion, pores in lipid bilayers and others.We analyze the energetics of tilt in liquid membranes and its coupling with membrane bending. We consider three contributions to the elastic energy: constant tilt, variation of tilt along the membrane surface and membrane bending. The major assumption of the model is that the core of a liquid membrane has the common properties of an elastic continuum. We show that the variation of tilt and membrane bending are additive and that their energy contributions are determined by the same elastic coefficient: the Helfrich bending modulus, the modulus of Gaussian curvature and the spontaneous curvature known from previous studies of pure bending. The energy of a combined deformation of bending and varying tilt is determined by an effective tensor accounting for the two factors. In contrast, the deformation of constant tilt does not couple with bending and its contribution to the elastic energy is determined by an indepen- dent elastic constant.While accurate determination of this constant requires additional measurements, we estimate its value using a simplified approach. We discuss the relationships between the obtained elastic Hamiltonian of a membrane and the previous models of membrane elasticity.},

In the case of the force-field parameters, the van der Waals constants for the non-bonded interaction of the ester carbonyl carbon and the partial charges and charge group definition of the phosphatidylcholine head group are examined. On the methodological side, different cut-off distances for the non-bonded interactions, use of a reaction-field force due to long-range electrostatic interactions, the frequency of removal of the centre of mass motion and the strength of the coupling of the pressure of the system to the pressure bath are tested. The area per lipid, as a measure of structure, the order parameters of the chain carbons, as a measure of membrane fluidity, and the translational diffusion of the lipids in the plane of the bilayer are calculated and compared with experimental values. An optimal set of simulation parameters for which the GROMOS96 parameter set 45A3 yields a head group area, chain order parameters and a lateral diffusion coefficient in accordance with the experimental data is listed.},

abstract = {Computational methods are powerful in capturing the results of experimental studies in terms of force fields that both explain and predict biological structures. Validation of molecular simulations requires comparison with experimental data to test and confirm computational predictions. Here we report a comprehensive database of NMR results for membrane phospholipids with interpretations intended to be accessible by non-NMR specialists. Experimental13C-1H and2H NMR segmental order parameters (SCHor SCD) and spin-lattice (Zeeman) relaxation times (T1Z) are summarized in convenient tabular form for various saturated, unsaturated, and biological membrane phospholipids. Segmental order parameters give direct information about bilayer structural properties, including the area per lipid and volumetric hydrocarbon thickness. In addition, relaxation rates provide complementary information about molecular dynamics. Particular attention is paid to the magnetic field dependence (frequency dispersion) of the NMR relaxation rates in terms of various simplified power laws. Model-free reduction of the T1Zstudies in terms of a power-law formalism shows that the relaxation rates for saturated phosphatidylcholines follow a single frequency-dispersive trend within the MHz regime. We show how analytical models can guide the continued development of atomistic and coarse-grained force fields. Our interpretation suggests that lipid diffusion and collective order fluctuations are implicitly governed by the viscoelastic nature of the liquid-crystalline ensemble. Collective bilayer excitations are emergent over mesoscopic length scales that fall between the molecular and bilayer dimensions, and are important for lipid organization and lipid-protein interactions. Future conceptual advances and theoretical reductions will foster understanding of biomembrane structural dynamics through a synergy of NMR measurements and molecular simulations. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Tissue differentiation is an important process that involves major cellular membrane remodeling. We used Madin-Darby canine kidney cells as a model for epithelium formation and investigated the remodeling of the total cell membrane lipidome during the transition from a nonpolarized morphology to an epithelial morphology and vice versa. To achieve this, we developed a shotgun-based lipidomics workflow that enabled the absolute quantification of mammalian membrane lipidomes with minimal sample processing from low sample amounts. Epithelial morphogenesis was accompanied by a major shift from sphingomyelin to glycosphingolipid, together with an increase in plasmalogen, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol content, whereas the opposite changes took place during an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, during polarization, the sphingolipids became longer, more saturated, and more hydroxylated as required to generate an apical membrane domain that serves as a protective barrier for the epithelial sheet.},

First, many exciting biophysical and cell biological processes take place within it. Second, experimental techniques manage to zoom in on this sub-optical scale, while computer simulations zoom out to system sizes previously unattainable, and both will be meeting soon. This paper reviews a selection of questions and concepts in this field and demonstrates that they can often be favorably addressed with highly simplified simulation models. Among the topics discussed are membrane adhesion to substrates, mixed lipid bilayers, lipid curvature coupling, pore formation by antimicrobial peptides, composition-driven protein aggregation, and curvature driven vesiculation.},

We chose DPPC as it is one of the most studied phospholipid species and thus has plenty of experimental data necessary for model validation, and it is also one of the highly important and abundant lipid types, e.g., in lung surfactant. Overall, PCs have not been previously parametrized in the OPLS-AA force field; thus, there is a need to derive its bonding and nonbonding parameters for both the polar and nonpolar parts of the molecule. In the present study, we determined the parameters for torsion angles in the phosphatidylcholine and glycerol moieties and in the acyl chains, as well the partial atomic charges. In these calculations, we used three methods: (1) Hartree-Fock (HF), (2) second order M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), and (3) density functional theory (DFT). We also tested the effect of the polar environment by using the polarizable continuum model (PCM), and for acyl chains the van der Waals parameters were also adjusted. In effect, six parameter sets were generated and tested on a DPPC bilayer. Out of these six sets, only one was found to be able to satisfactorily reproduce experimental data for the lipid bilayer. The successful DPPC model was obtained from MP2 calculations in an implicit polar environment (PCM).},

The membrane skeleton (MSK) primarily consists of actin filaments and associated proteins. The MSK covers the entire cytoplasmic surface and is closely linked to clathrin-coated pits and caveolae. The actin filaments that are closely apposed to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane (within 10.2 nm) are likely to form the boundaries of the membrane compartments responsible for the temporary confinement of membrane molecules, thus partitioning the plasma membrane with regard to their lateral diffusion. The distribution of the MSK mesh size as determined by electron tomography and that of the compartment size as determined from high speed single-particle tracking of phospholipid diffusion agree well in both cell types, supporting the MSK fence and MSK-anchored protein picket models.},

Yet, its value has been measured only for a handful of simple lipids, and no simulation has so far determined it better than a factor of two, rendering a systematic investigation of such enticing speculations impossible. Here we propose a highly accurate method to determine ?? in computer simulations. It relies on the interplay between curvature stress and edge tension of partially curved axisymmetric membrane disks and requires determining their closing probability. For a simplified lipid model we obtain ?? and its relation to the normal bending modulus ?? for membranes differing both in stiffness and spontaneous lipid curvature. The elastic ratio ??/?? can be determined with a few percent statistical accuracy. Its value agrees with the scarce experimental data, and its change with spontaneous lipid curvature is compatible with theoretical expectations, thereby granting additional information on monolayer properties. We also show that an alternative determination of these elastic parameters based on moments of the lateral stress profile gives markedly different and unphysical values. ?? 2012 Biophysical Society.},

@article{Buchoux2017,
abstract = {When studying biological membranes, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations reveal to be quite complementary to experimental techniques. Because the simulated systems keep increasing both in size and complexity, the analysis of MD trajectories need to be computationally efficient while being robust enough to perform analysis on membranes that may be curved or deformed due to their size and/or protein-lipid interactions. This work presents a new software named FATSLiM ('Fast Analysis Toolbox for Simulations of Lipid Membranes') that can extract physical properties from MD simulations of membranes (with or without interacting proteins). Because it relies on the calculation of local normals, FATSLiM does not depend of the bilayer morphology and thus can handle with the same accuracy vesicles for instance. Thanks to an efficiency-driven development, it is also fast and consumes a rather low amount of memory. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION FATSLiM (http://fatslim.github.io) is a stand-alone software written in Python.

The values calculated on the geometric structures can be visualized in a user-friendly interactive environment and, then, plotted and exported to different file types. APL@Voro supports complex bilayers with a mix of various lipids and proteins. For the calculation of the projected area per lipid, a modification of the well-known Voronoi approach is presented as well as the presentation of a new approach for including atoms into an existing triangulation. The application of the developed software is discussed for three example systems simulated with GROMACS. The program is written in C++, is open source, and is available free of charge.},

However, the parametrization of accurate, reliable, and consistent coarse-grained (CG) models for systems at interfaces remains a challenging endeavor. In the present work, we explore to what extent two independently developed solvent-free CG models of peptides and lipids--of different mapping schemes, parametrization methods, target functions, and validation criteria--can be combined by only tuning the cross-interactions. Our results show that the cross-parametrization can reproduce a number of structural properties of membrane peptides (for example, tilt and hydrophobic mismatch), in agreement with existing peptide-lipid CG force fields. We find encouraging results for two challenging biophysical problems: (i) membrane pore formation mediated by the cooperative action of several antimicrobial peptides, and (ii) the insertion and folding of the helix-forming peptide WALP23 in the membrane.},

abstract = {Lipid membranes in prokaryotes and eukaryotes have a wide array of lipids that are necessary for proper membrane structure and function. In this paper, an introduction to lipid diversity in biology and a mini-review on how molecular simulations have been used to model biological membranes (primarily limited to one to three lipid types in most simulation-based models) is provided, which motivates the use of all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to study the effect of lipid diversity on properties of realistic membrane models of prokaryotes and eukaryotes. As an example, cytoplasmic membrane models of Escherichia coli were developed at different stages of the colony growth cycle (early-log, mid-log, stationary and overnight). The main difference between lipid compositions at each stage was the concentration of a cyclopropane-containing moiety on the sn-2 lipid acyl chain (cyC17:0). Triplicate MD simulations for each stage were run for 300 ns to study the influence of lipid diversity on the surface area per lipid, area compressibility modulus, deuterium order parameters, and electron density profiles. The overnight stage (also known as the death stage) had the highest average surface area per lipid, highest rigidity, and lowest bilayer thickness compare to other stages of E. coli cytoplasmic membrane. Although bilayer thickness did depend on the growth stage, the changes between these were small suggesting that the hydrophobic core of transmembrane proteins fit well with the membrane in all growth stages. Although it is still common practise in MD simulations of membrane proteins to use simple one- or two-component membranes, it can be important to use diverse lipid model membranes when membrane protein structure and function are influenced by changes in lipid membrane composition.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers composed of 72 and 288 lipids are used to examine system size dependence on dynamical properties associated with the particle mesh Ewald (PME) treatment of electrostatic interactions. The lateral diffusion constant Dl is 2.92 x 10(-7) and 0.95 x 10(-7) cm2/s for 72 and 288 lipids, respectively. This dramatic finite size effect originates from the correlation length of lipid diffusion, which extends to next-nearest neighbors in the 288 lipid system. Consequently, diffusional events in smaller systems can propagate across the boundaries of the periodic box. The internal dynamics of lipids calculated from the PME simulations are independent of the system size. Specifically, reorientational correlation functions for the slowly relaxing phosphorus-glycerol hydrogen, phosphorus-nitrogen vectors, and more rapidly relaxing CH vectors in the aliphatic chains are equivalent for the 72 and 288 lipid simulations. A third MD simulation of a bilayer with 72 lipids using spherical force-shift electrostatic cutoffs resulted in interdigitated chains, thereby rendering this cutoff method inappropriate.},

abstract = {We present the first observations of giant, long-existing, stabilized pores in vesicle membranes. Using a new experimental technique for studying the electropermeabilization of lipid membranes, giant liposomes (from 25 to 56 $\mu$m in diameter) were subjected to single, square, electric pulses (duration 150 $\mu$s and electric field strength from 63 to 126 kV/m). The liposomes were held by a micropipet and small membrane tensions were created by controlling the pipet suction pressure. The liposomes were loaded with media having different refractive index from the outside solution, and, under these conditions, the formation of pores in the pressurized liposome could be visualized by the jet of inside solution that flowed out from the membrane pore. By adjusting the membrane tension, pores were kept open, and pore lifetimes could be varied from tenths of a second to several seconds. The pore size was determined from the volumetric flow in the pore region and the measured pressure differences across the bilayer. It was clear from the experiments that only one pore remained opened after the pulse. The estimated pore radii were on the order of one micrometer. The pores were in a quasi-stationary state and when they closed they did so spontaneously in a quick process (in milliseconds). The isotropic membrane tension was determined for the same measurements and from determinations of both pore size and dynamic membrane tension the pore line tension was found. The line tension of the pore region was determined for two lipid compositions, stearoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and stearoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine with 50 mol{\%} cholesterol, and the obtained values for single bilayers were (0.92 ± 0.07){\textperiodcentered}10-11 N and (3.05 ± 0.12){\textperiodcentered}10-11 N, respectively. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

abstract = {This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License. It is maintained by a group of developers from the Universities of Groningen, Uppsala, and Stockholm, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research in Mainz. Its Web site is http://www.gromacs.org.},

abstract = {A theory of the elasticity of lipid bilayers is proposed. Three types of strain, i. e. stretching, tilt and curvature, are distinguished and the associated stresses are identified. It is argued that in the case of vesicles (= closed bilayer films) the only elasticity controlling nonspherical shapes is that of curvature. Euler-Lagrange equations are derived for the shape in magnetic fields and under excess outside pressure. It is shown that magnetic fields can deform spherical vesicles into ellipsoids of revolution. Under excess outside pressure the spherical shape becomes unstable at a certain threshold pressure. Both effects can be influenced by a spontaneous curvature of the bilayer. Some possible experiments to determine the elastic properties are also discussed.},

abstract = {Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations have become an important source of information for the structure and dynamics of biomembranes at molecular detail difficult to access in experiments. A number of force fields for lipid membrane simulations have been derived in the past; the choice of the most suitable force field is, however, frequently hampered by the availability of parameters for specific lipids. Additionally, the comparison of different quantities among force fields is often aggravated by varying simulation parameters. Here, we compare four atomistic lipid force fields, namely, the united-atom GROMOS54a7 and the all-atom force fields CHARMM36, Slipids, and Lipid14, for a broad range of structural and dynamical properties of saturated and monounsaturated phosphatidylcholine bilayers (DMPC and POPC) as well as for monounsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers (POPE). Additionally, the ability of the different force fields to describe the gel−liquid crystalline phase transition is compared and their computational efficiency estimated. Moreover, membrane properties like the water flux across the lipid bilayer and lipid acyl chain protrusion probabilities are compared.},

The ATB has three primary functions: (1) to act as a repository for molecules that have been parametrized as part of theGROMOSfamily of force fields, (2) to act as a repository for pre-equilibrated systems for use as starting configurations in molecular dynamics simulations (solvent mixtures, lipid systems pre-equilibrated to adopt a specific phase, etc.), and (3) to generate force field descriptions of novelmolecules compatible with theGROMOSfamily of force fields in a variety of formats (GROMOS, GROMACS, and CNS). Force field descriptions of novel molecules are derived using a multistep process in which results from quantum mechanical (QM) calculations are combined with a knowledge-based approach to ensure compatibility (as far as possible) with a specific parameter set of theGROMOSforce field. The ATBhas several unique features: (1) It requires that the user stipulate the protonation and tautomeric states of the molecule. (2) The symmetry of the molecule is analyzed to ensure that equivalent atoms are assigned identical parameters. (3) Charge groups are assigned automatically. (4) Where the assignment of a given parameter is ambiguous, a range of possible alternatives is provided. The ATB also provides several validation tools to assist the user to assess the degree to which the topology generated may be appropriate for a given task. In addition to detailing the steps involved in generating a force field topology compatible with a specific GROMOS parameter set (GROMOS 53A6), the challenges involved in the automatic generation of force field parameters for atomic simulations in general are discussed.},

The efficacy of these new features was tested by building and simulating lipid bilayers that resemble yeast membranes, composed of cholesterol, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, dioleoylphosphatidylcholine, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine, palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylamine, and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine. Four membranes with varying concentrations of cholesterol and phospholipids were simulated, for a total of 170 ns at 303.15 K. Unsaturated phospholipid chain concentration had the largest influence on membrane properties, such as average lipid surface area, density profiles, deuterium order parameters, and cholesterol tilt angle. Simulations with a high concentration of unsaturated chains (73{\%}, membrane(unsat)) resulted in a significant increase in lipid surface area and a decrease in deuterium order parameters, compared with membranes with a high concentration of saturated chains (60-63{\%}, membrane(sat)). The average tilt angle of cholesterol with respect to bilayer normal was largest, and the distribution was significantly broader for membrane(unsat). Moreover, short-lived cholesterol orientations parallel to the membrane surface existed only for membrane(unsat). The membrane(sat) simulations were in a liquid-ordered state, and agree with similar experimental cholesterol-containing membranes.},

It has been developed over the last three decades with a primary focus on molecules of biological interest, including proteins, peptides, lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and small molecule ligands, as they occur in solution, crystals, and membrane environments. For the study of such systems, the program provides a large suite of computational tools that include numerous conformational and path sampling methods, free energy estimators, molecular minimization, dynamics, and analysis techniques, and model-building capabilities. The CHARMM program is applicable to problems involving a much broader class of many-particle systems. Calculations with CHARMM can be performed using a number of different energy functions and models, from mixed quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical force fields, to all-atom classical potential energy functions with explicit solvent and various boundary conditions, to implicit solvent and membrane models. The program has been ported to numerous platforms in both serial and parallel architectures. This article provides an overview of the program as it exists today with an emphasis on developments since the publication of the original CHARMM article in 1983.},

We write two coupled equations of the time evolution of the radii r(t) of the hole and R(t) of the vesicle, which both act on the release of the membrane tension. We find four periods in the life of a transient pore: (I) exponential growth of the young pore; (II) stop of the growth at a maximum radius rm; (III) slow closure limited by the leak-out; (IV) fast closure below a critical radius, when leak-out becomes negligible.

NAMD scales to hundreds of processors on high-end parallel platforms, as well as tens of processors on low-cost commodity clusters, and also runs on individual desktop and laptop computers. NAMD works with AMBER and CHARMM potential functions, parameters, and file formats. This article, directed to novices as well as experts, first introduces concepts and methods used in the NAMD program, describing the classical molecular dynamics force field, equations of motion, and integration methods along with the efficient electrostatics evaluation algorithms employed and temperature and pressure controls used. Features for steering the simulation across barriers and for calculating both alchemical and conformational free energy differences are presented. The motivations for and a roadmap to the internal design of NAMD, implemented in C++ and based on Charm++ parallel objects, are outlined. The factors affecting the serial and parallel performance of a simulation are discussed. Finally, typical NAMD use is illustrated with representative applications to a small, a medium, and a large biomolecular system, highlighting particular features of NAMD, for example, the Tcl scripting language. The article also provides a list of the key features of NAMD and discusses the benefits of combining NAMD with the molecular graphics/sequence analysis software VMD and the grid computing/collaboratory software BioCoRE.

abstract = {A new coarse-grain model for molecular dynamics simulation of lipid membranes is presented. Following a simple and conventional approach, lipid molecules are modeled by spherical sites, each representing a group of several atoms. In contrast to common coarse-grain methods, two original (interdependent) features are here adopted. First, the main electrostatics are modeled explicitly by charges and dipoles, which interact realistically through a relative dielectric constant of unity ($\epsilon$(r) = 1). Second, water molecules are represented individually through a new parametrization of the simple Stockmayer potential for polar fluids; each water molecule is therefore described by a single spherical site embedded with a point dipole. The force field is shown to accurately reproduce the main physical properties of single-species phospholipid bilayers comprising dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE) in the liquid crystal phase, as well as distearoylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) in the liquid crystal and gel phases. Insights are presented into fundamental properties and phenomena that can be difficult or impossible to study with alternative computational or experimental methods. For example, we investigate the internal pressure distribution, dipole potential, lipid diffusion, and spontaneous self-assembly. Simulations lasting up to 1.5 microseconds were conducted for systems of different sizes (128, 512 and 1058 lipids); this also allowed us to identify size-dependent artifacts that are expected to affect membrane simulations in general. Future extensions and applications are discussed, particularly in relation to the methodology's inherent multiscale capabilities.},

The choline resonance of headgroup-protiated DPPC exchanged into the outer leaflet of headgroup-deuterated DPPC-d13 vesicles was monitored using (1)H NMR spectroscopy, coupled with the addition of a paramagnetic shift reagent. This allowed us to distinguish between the inner and outer bilayer leaflet of DPPC, to determine the flip-flop rate as a function of temperature. Flip-flop of fluid-phase DPPC exhibited Arrhenius kinetics, from which we determined an activation energy of 122 kJ mol(-1). In gel-phase DPPC vesicles, flip-flop was not observed over the course of 250 h. Our findings are in contrast to previous studies of solid-supported bilayers, where the reported DPPC translocation rates are at least several orders of magnitude faster than those in vesicles at corresponding temperatures. We reconcile these differences by proposing a defect-mediated acceleration of lipid translocation in supported bilayers, where long-lived, submicron-sized holes resulting from incomplete surface coverage are the sites of rapid transbilayer movement.},

Diffusion of transmembrane protein and, indeed, even lipid is anomalous in that the molecules tend to diffuse freely in limited size compartments, with infrequent intercompartment transitions. This average residency time in a compartment is dependent on the diffusing species and on its state of oligomerization, becoming completely confined to a single compartment upon sufficient oligomerization. This will be of great importance in determining cellular mechanisms for controlling the random diffusive motion of membrane molecules and in understanding signalling processes.},

Initially created by electroporation, the pores remain open for up to several seconds before quickly snapping shut. This result is surprising in light of the large line tension for holes in bilayer membranes and the rapid time scale for closure of large pores. We show how pores can be dynamically stabilized via a new feedback mechanism. We also explain quantitatively the observed sudden pore closure as a tangent bifurcation. Finally we show how Zhelev and Needham's experiment can be used to measure accurately the pore line tension, an important material parameter.

Biochemical and biophysical findings have provided a detailed model of the composition and structure of membranes, which includes levels of dynamic organization both across the lipid bilayer (lipid asymmetry) and in the lateral dimension (lipid domains) of membranes. How do cells apply anabolic and catabolic enzymes, translocases and transporters, plus the intrinsic physical phase behaviour of lipids and their interactions with membrane proteins, to create the unique compositions and multiple functionalities of their individual membranes?},

abstract = {We investigate the role of lipid chemical potential on the shape, thickness, and molecular orientation (lipid tilting relative to the monolayer surface normal) of lipid bilayers via a continuum-level model. We predict that decreasing the chemical potential at constant temperature, which is associated with an increase in surface tension via the Gibbs-Duhem relation, leads both to the well known reduction in thermal membrane undulations and also to increasing fluctuation amplitudes for bilayer thickness and molecular orientation. These trends are shown to be in good agreement with molecular simulations, however it is impossible to achieve full quantitative agreement between theory and simulation within the confines of the present model. We suggest that the assumption of lipid volume incompressibility, common to our theoretical treatment and other continuum models in the literature, may be partially responsible for the quantitative discrepancies between theory and simulation.},

Changes in free energy for isothermal deformations of a fluid are expressible as volume integrals of the stress tensor 'times' a strain tensor. A particular radial distortion of a drop leads to statistical mechanical expressions for the pressure difference across the surface of the drop. We find that the stress tensor is not uniquely defined by the microscopic laws embodying the conservation of momentum and angular momentum and that the ambiguity remains in the ensemble average, or pressure tensor, in regions of inhomogeneity.

abstract = {We present an elastic Hamiltonian for membrane energetics that captures bilayer undulation and peristaltic deformations over all wavelengths, including the short wavelength protrusion regime. The model implies continuous functional forms for thermal undulation and peristaltic amplitudes as a function of wavelength and predicts previously overlooked relationships between these curves. Undulation and peristaltic spectra display excellent agreement with data from both atomistic and coarse-grained models over all simulated length scales. Additionally, the model accurately predicts the bilayer's response to a cylindrical protein inclusion as observed in coarse-grained simulation. This elastic response provides an explanation for gramicidin ion channel lifetime versus membrane thickness data that requires no fit constants. The physical parameters inherent to this picture may be expressed in terms of familiar material properties associated with lipid monolayers. Inclusion of a finite monolayer spontaneous curvature is essential to obtain fully consistent agreement between theory and the full range of available simulation/experimental data.},

The macroscopic diffusion coefficient D(macro) for self-diffusion of 16-PC spin label is obtained from imaging the concentration profiles as a function of time, and it is (2.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(-8) cm2/s at 22-degrees-C.  The microscopic diffusion coefficient D(micro) for relative diffusion of the spin probes is obtained from the variation of the spectral line broadening with spin label concentration, which is due to spin-spin interactions.  D(micro) is found to be substantially greater than D(macro) for the same sample at the same conditions, and is estimated to be at least (1.0 +/- 0.4) x 10(-7) cm2/s.  Possible sources for their difference are briefly discussed in terms of the models used for D(micro).},

We have improved computational membrane models for specific organelles in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to study the effect of lipid diversity on membrane structure and dynamics. Previous molecular dynamics simulations were performed by Jo et al. [(2009) Biophys J. 97, 50-58] on yeast membrane models having six lipid types with compositions averaged between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the plasma membrane (PM). We incorporated ergosterol, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylinositol lipids in our models to better describe the unique composition of the PM, ER, and trans-Golgi network (TGN) bilayers of yeast. Our results describe membrane structure based on order parameters (SCD), electron density profiles (EDPs), and lipid packing. The average surface area per lipid decreased from 63.8 ± 0.4 {\AA}(2) in the ER to 47.1 ± 0.3 {\AA}(2) in the PM, while the compressibility modulus (KA) varied in the opposite direction. The high SCD values for the PM lipids indicated a more ordered bilayer core, while the corresponding lipids in the ER and TGN models had lower parameters by a factor of at least 0.7. The hydrophobic core thickness (2DC) as estimated from EDPs is the thickest for PM, which is in agreement with estimates of hydrophobic regions of transmembrane proteins from the Orientation of Proteins in Membranes database. Our results show the importance of lipid diversity and composition on a bilayer's structural and mechanical properties, which in turn influences interactions with the proteins and membrane-bound molecules.},

abstract = {We present an implicit solvent coarse-grained (CG) model for quantitative simulations of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) bilayers. The absence of explicit solvent enables membrane simulations on large length and time scales at moderate computational expense. Despite improved computational efficiency, the model preserves chemical specificity and quantitative accuracy. The bonded and nonbonded interactions together with the effective cohesion mimicking the hydrophobic effect were systematically tuned by matching structural and mechanical properties from experiments and all-atom bilayer simulations, such as saturated area per lipid, radial distribution functions, density and pressure profiles across the bilayer, P(2) order, etc. The CG lipid model is shown to self-assemble into a bilayer starting from a random dispersion. Its line tension and elastic properties, such as bending and stretching modulus, are semiquantitatively consistent with experiments. The effects of (i) reduced molecular friction and (ii) more efficient integration combine to an overall speed-up of 3-4 orders of magnitude compared to all-atom bilayer simulations. Our CG lipid model is especially useful for studies of large-scale phenomena in membranes that nevertheless require a fair description of chemical specificity, e.g., membrane patches interacting with movable and transformable membrane proteins and peptides.},

Simulations of all-atom DPPC and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) bilayers yield diffusion constants not far from experiment.

abstract = {Background: Molecular Mechanics (MM) is the method of choice for computational studies of biomolecular systems owing to its modest computational cost, which makes it possible to routinely perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on chemical systems of biophysical and biomedical relevance. Scope of review: As one of the main factors limiting the accuracy of MD results is the empirical force field used, the present paper offers a review of recent developments in the CHARMM additive force field, one of the most popular biomolecular force fields. Additionally, we present a detailed discussion of the CHARMM Drude polarizable force field, anticipating a growth in the importance and utilization of polarizable force fields in the near future. Throughout the discussion emphasis is placed on the force fields' parametrization philosophy and methodology. Major conclusions: Recent improvements in the CHARMM additive force field are mostly related to newly found weaknesses in the previous generation of additive force fields. Beyond the additive approximation is the newly available CHARMM Drude polarizable force field, which allows for MD simulations of up to 1 $\mu$s on proteins, DNA, lipids and carbohydrates. General significance: Addressing the limitations ensures the reliability of the new CHARMM36 additive force field for the types of calculations that are presently coming into routine computational reach while the availability of the Drude polarizable force fields offers an inherently more accurate model of the underlying physical forces driving macromolecular structures and dynamics. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled "Recent developments of molecular dynamics".},

The robustness of Micelle Builder is tested by simulating four detergent-only homogeneous micelles of DHPC (dihexanoylphosphatidylcholine), DPC (dodecylphosphocholine), TPC (tetradecylphosphocholine), and SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) and comparing the calculated micelle properties with experiments and previous simulations. As a representative protein/micelle model, Pf1 coat protein is modeled and simulated in DHPC micelles with three different numbers of DHPC molecules. While the number of DHPC molecules in direct contact with Pf1 protein converges during the simulation, distinct behavior and geometry of micelles lead to different protein conformations in comparison to that in bilayers. It is our hope that CHARMM-GUI Micelle Builder can be used for simulation studies of various protein/micelle systems to better understand the protein structure and dynamics in micelles as well as distribution of detergents and their dynamics around proteins.},

@article{Castro-Roman2006,
abstract = {In the absence of external stress, the surface tension of a lipid membrane vanishes at equilibrium, and the membrane exhibits long wavelength undulations that can be described as elastic (as opposed to tension-dominated) deformations. These long wavelength fluctuations are generally suppressed in molecular dynamics simulations of membranes, which have typically been carried out on membrane patches with areas {\textless}100 nm2 that are replicated by periodic boundary conditions. As a result, finite system-size effects in molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers have been subject to much discussion in the membrane simulation community for several years, and it has been argued that it is necessary to simulate small membrane patches under tension to properly model the tension-free state of macroscopic membranes. Recent hardware and software advances have made it possible to simulate larger, all-atom systems allowing us to directly address the question of whether the relatively small size of current membrane simulations affects their physical characteristics compared to real macroscopic bilayer systems. In this work, system-size effects on the structure of a DOPC bilayer at 5.4 H2O/lipid are investigated by performing molecular dynamics simulations at constant temperature and isotropic pressure (i.e., vanishing surface tension) of small and large single bilayer patches (72 and 288 lipids, respectively), as well as an explicitly multilamellar system consisting of a stack of five 72-lipid bilayers, all replicated in three dimensions by using periodic boundary conditions. The simulation results are compared to X-ray and neutron diffraction data by using a model-free, reciprocal space approach developed recently in our laboratories. Our analysis demonstrates that finite-size effects are negligible in simulations of DOPC bilayers at low hydration, and suggests that refinements are needed in the simulation force fields.},

Continuum-based models developed within the frameworks of elasticity theory, fluid dynamics and statistical mechanics provide a framework for studying membrane biophysics over a range of mesoscopic to macroscopic length and time regimes, but the application of such ideas to simulation studies has occurred only relatively recently. We review some of our efforts in this direction with emphasis on the dynamics in model membrane systems. Several examples are presented that highlight the prominent role of hydrodynamics in membrane dynamics and we argue that careful consideration of fluid dynamics is key to understanding membrane biophysics at the cellular scale.},

abstract = {In this study, the influence of cholesterol on lipid bilayers is investigated by changing phospholipid headgroup, cholesterol concentration, chain saturation, and temperature. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to characterize bilayers containing phosphatidylcholine (PC) head groups with either fully saturated dimyristoyl (DM) or monounsaturated dioleoyl (DO) acyl chains and cholesterol concentrations ranging from 5 to 50{\%}. To further explore the effects of cholesterol on bilayers with different head groups, we also performed MD simulations of bilayer systems having 15{\%} cholesterol with phosphatidic acid (PA), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), and phosphatidylserine (PS), each having DM chains and at a temperature above the solid gel phase transition. Additionally, bilayers of DMPA, DMPE, and DMPS with 15{\%} cholesterol were simulated at temperatures below the solid gel phase transition temperatures. Compared to membranes without cholesterol, cholesterol in the model bilayers increases chain order in bilayers with the highest order in the liquid ordered and solid gel phases. Head group properties and acyl chain saturation are also found to critically impact bilayer dynamics, largely through the formation of hydrogen bonds between membrane components. These results provide a better understanding of the basic characteristics on structure and dynamics of cholesterol-containing membranes by revealing molecular details of interactions between cholesterol and phospholipids as well as add to the library of simulation data necessary for the MD community to accurately represent relevant models of atomic-scale systems.},

abstract = {Difficulties in estimating the correct number of lipids in each leaflet of complex bilayer membrane simulation systems make it inevitable to introduce a mismatch in lipid packing (i.e., area per lipid) and thus alter the lateral pressure of each leaflet. To investigate potential impacts of such mismatch on simulation results, we performed molecular dynamics simulations of saturated and mono- unsaturated lipid bilayers with and without gramicidin A or WALP23 at various mismatches by adjusting the number of lipids in the lower leaflet from no mismatch to a 25{\%} reduction compared to that in the upper leaflet. All simula- tions were stable under the constant pressure barostat, but the mismatch induces asymmetric lipid packing between the leaflets, so that the upper leaflet becomes more ordered, and the lower leaflet becomes less ordered. The mismatch impacts on various bilayer properties are mild up to 5−10{\%} mismatch, and bilayers with fully saturated chains appear to be more prone to these impacts than those with unsaturated tails. The nonvanishing leaflet surface tensions and the free energy derivatives with respect to the bilayer curvature indicate that the bilayer would be energetically unstable in the presence of mismatch. We propose a quantitative criterion for allowable mismatch based on the energetics derived from a continuum elastic model, which grows as a square root of the number of the lipids in the system. On the basis of this criterion, we infer that the area per lipid mismatch up to 5{\%} would be tolerable in various membrane simulations of reasonable all-atom system sizes (40−160 lipids per leaflet). ■},

To reproduce the free energies of these chemical building blocks, the number of possible interaction levels of the coarse-grained sites has increased compared to those of the previous model. Application of the new model to lipid bilayers shows an improved behavior in terms of the stress profile across the bilayer and the tendency to form pores. An extension of the force field now also allows the simulation of planar (ring) compounds, including sterols. Application to a bilayer/cholesterol system at various concentrations shows the typical cholesterol condensation effect similar to that observed in all atom representations.},

In elongated boxes, the diffusion coefficients normal to the long axis diverge linearly with the height-to-width ratio. For both lipid membranes and neat fluids, this behavior is predicted quantitatively by hydrodynamic theory. Mean-square displacements in the neat fluid exhibit intermediate regimes of anomalous diffusion, with t ln t and t3/2 components in flat and elongated boxes, respectively. For membranes, the large finite-size effects, and the apparent inability to determine a well-defined lipid diffusion coefficien...},

By means of simple pair potentials these robustly self-assemble to a fluid bilayer state over a wide range of parameters, without the need for an explicit solvent. The model shows the expected elastic behavior on large length scales, and its physical properties (e.g., fluidity or bending stiffness) can be widely tuned via a single parameter. In particular, bending rigidities in the experimentally relevant range are obtained, at least within 3-30 k(B) T.

abstract = {Macromolecular crowding dramatically affects cellular processes such as protein folding and assembly, regulation of metabolic pathways, and condensation of DNA. Despite increased attention, we still lack a definition for how crowded a heterogeneous environment is at the molecular scale and how this manifests in basic physical phenomena like diffusion. Here, we show by means of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and computer simulations that crowding manifests itself through the emergence of anomalous subdiffusion of cytoplasmic macromolecules. In other words, the mean square displacement of a protein will grow less than linear in time and the degree of this anomality depends on the size and conformation of the traced particle and on the total protein concentration of the solution. We therefore propose that the anomality of the diffusion can be used as a quantifiable measure for the crowdedness of the cytoplasm at the molecular scale. {\textcopyright} 2004 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulations have become an essential tool to study a large variety of biomolecular processes, exploring temporal and spatial scales inaccessible to traditional models of atomistic resolution. One of the major simplifications of CG models is the representation of the solvent, which is either implicit or modeled explicitly as a van der Waals particle. The effect of polarization, and thus a proper screening of interactions depending on the local environment, is absent. Given the important role of water as a ubiquitous solvent in biological systems, its treatment is crucial to the properties derived from simulation studies. Here, we parameterize a polarizable coarse-grained water model to be used in combination with the CG MARTINI force field. Using a three-bead model to represent four water molecules, we show that the orientational polarizability of real water can be effectively accounted for. This has the consequence that the dielectric screening of bulk water is reproduced. At the same time, we parameterized our new water model such that bulk water density and oil/water partitioning data remain at the same level of accuracy as for the standard MARTINI force field. We apply the new model to two cases for which current CG force fields are inadequate. First, we address the transport of ions across a lipid membrane. The computed potential of mean force shows that the ions now naturally feel the change in dielectric medium when moving from the high dielectric aqueous phase toward the low dielectric membrane interior. In the second application we consider the electroporation process of both an oil slab and a lipid bilayer. The electrostatic field drives the formation of water filled pores in both cases, following a similar mechanism as seen with atomistically detailed models.},

Given the wide disparity between what is possible on today's computers and the problems one might like to study, it seems unlikely this situation will change for several decades. An appealing alternative to traditional computational approaches is to employ simpler, continuum-based models developed within the frameworks of elasticity theory, fluid dynamics, and statistical mechanics. Although such models have seen wide use in analytical descriptions of membrane behavior, the extension of these methods to more general situations and numerical analysis is just beginning to be explored. This article reviews continuum models for membrane behavior with an emphasis on the use of such models in computational studies. Two applications are explored to demonstrate the utility of this level of coarse-grained modeling.},

abstract = {Successive parameterizations of the GROMOS force field have been used successfully to simulate biomolecular systems over a long period of time. The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the GROMOS force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the GROMOS force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the GROMOS force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, 53A5 and 53A6, were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane (53A5). The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water (53A6). Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed.},

A number of force fields for lipid membrane simulations have been derived in the past; the choice of the most suitable force field is, however, frequently hampered by the availability of parameters for specific lipids. Additionally, the comparison of different quantities among force fields is often aggravated by varying simulation parameters. Here, we compare four atomistic lipid force fields, namely, the united-atom GROMOS54a7 and the all-atom force fields CHARMM36, Slipids, and Lipid14, for a broad range of structural and dynamical properties of saturated and monounsaturated phosphatidylcholine bilayers (DMPC and POPC) as well as for monounsaturated phosphatidylethanolamine bilayers (POPE). Additionally, the ability of the different force fields to describe the gel−liquid crystalline phase transition is compared and their computational efficiency estimated. Moreover, membrane properties like the water flux across the lipid bilayer and lipid acyl chain protrusion probabilities are compared.},

abstract = {A significant modification to the additive all-atom CHARMM lipid force field (FF) is developed and applied to phospholipid bilayers with both choline and ethanolamine containing head groups and with both saturated and unsaturated aliphatic chains. Motivated by the current CHARMM lipid FF (C27 and C27r) systematically yielding values of the surface area per lipid that are smaller than experimental estimates and gel-like structures of bilayers well above the gel transition temperature, selected torsional, Lennard-Jones and partial atomic charge parameters were modified by targeting both quantum mechanical (QM) and experimental data. QM calculations ranging from high-level ab initio calculations on small molecules to semiempirical QM studies on a 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayer in combination with experimental thermodynamic data were used as target data for parameter optimization. These changes were tested with simulations of pure bilayers at high hydration of the following six lipids: DPPC, 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DMPC), 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DLPC), 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (POPC), 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE); simulations of a low hydration DOPC bilayer were also performed. Agreement with experimental surface area is on average within 2{\%}, and the density profiles agree well with neutron and X-ray diffraction experiments. NMR deuterium order parameters (S(CD)) are well predicted with the new FF, including proper splitting of the S(CD) for the aliphatic carbon adjacent to the carbonyl for DPPC, POPE, and POPC bilayers. The area compressibility modulus and frequency dependence of (13)C NMR relaxation rates of DPPC and the water distribution of low hydration DOPC bilayers also agree well with experiment. Accordingly, the presented lipid FF, referred to as C36, allows for molecular dynamics simulations to be run in the tensionless ensemble (NPT), and is anticipated to be of utility for simulations of pure lipid systems as well as heterogeneous systems including membrane proteins.},

Two such tail-tail potentials were tested, with the important feature in both cases being a variable range of attraction. We examined phase diagrams of this range versus temperature for both functional forms of the tail-tail attraction and found that a certain threshold attractive width was required to stabilize the fluid phase. Within the fluid-phase region we find that material properties such as area per lipid, orientational order, diffusion constant, interleaflet flip-flop rate, and bilayer stiffness all depend strongly and monotonically on the attractive width. For three particular values of the potential width we investigate the transition between gel and fluid phases via heating or cooling and find that this transition is discontinuous with considerable hysteresis. We also investigated the stretching of a bilayer to eventually form a pore and found excellent agreement with recent analytic theory.},

abstract = {Solvent hydrodynamics are incorporated into simulations of the solvent-free Dry Martini model. The solvent hydrodynamics are modeled with the stochastic rotation dynamics (SRD) algorithm, a particle-based method for resolving fluid hydrodynamics. SRD does not require calculation of particle-particle distances in the solvent, and so is scalable to arbitrary volumes of solvent with minimal additional computational overhead. The viscosity of the solvent is easily tuned via parameters of the algorithm to span an order of magnitude in viscosity around the viscosity of water at room temperature. The combination “Stochastic Thermostatted Rotation Dynamics (STRD) with Martini” was implemented in Gromacs v.5.01. Simulations of an SRD/palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine membrane demonstrate that the solvent may be included without reparametrizing the lipid model, with minimal perturbation to the thermodynamics. A recent generalization of Saffman-Delbruck theory to periodic geometries by Camley and Brown indicates that lipid dynamics are contaminated by a finite-size effect in typical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and that very large systems are required for quantitative simulation of dynamics. Analysis of lipid translational diffusion in this work shows good agreement with the theory, and with explicitly solvated simulations. This indicates that STRD Martini is a viable approach for quantitative simulation of membrane dynamics and does not require massive computational overhead to model the solvent.},

abstract = {This chapter describes relationships, starting out from a microscopic, molecular picture of amphiphile organization in the membrane. Fluid bilayers are very flexible because they can relax a shear stress by hydrodynamic flow. The most important elastic modulus is their bending rigidity which may be related to the molecular structure of the membrane as reviewed in the chapter. Biological membranes, the subject matter of this volume, are extremely complex physico–chemical systems, not to mention their biological aspects. Even the “model” amphiphilic bilayers, which have been considered and which serve to mimic real membranes are also very complex many-body systems. In addition to their biological relevance, these systems are interesting and challenging theoretically because of the special coupling between their microscopic and macroscopic behaviors and because of their self-organizing characteristics. Most of the relevant information on either biological or model membranes is, naturally, experimental. On the other hand, analytical theories, such as mean field models, often provide the explicit parameter dependence. Furthermore, mean field theories may also be useful in suggesting the parameters and conditions that should be studied via simulation. {\textcopyright} 1995, Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become a highly important technique to consider lipid membrane systems, and quite often they provide considerable added value to laboratory experiments. Rapid development of both software and hardware has enabled the increase of time and size scales reachable by MD simulations to match those attainable by several accurate experimental techniques. However, until recently, the quality and maturity of software tools available for building membrane models for simulations as well as analyzing the results of these simulations have seriously lagged behind. Here, we discuss the recent developments of such tools from the end-users' point of view. In particular, we review the software that can be employed to build lipid bilayers and other related structures with or without embedded membrane proteins to be employed in MD simulations. Additionally, we provide a brief critical insight into force fields and MD packages commonly used for membrane and membrane protein simulations. Finally, we list analysis tools that can be used to study the properties of membrane and membrane protein systems. In all these points we comment on the respective compatibility of the covered tools. We also share our opinion on the current state of the available software. We briefly discuss the most commonly employed tools and platforms on which new software can be built. We conclude the review by providing a few ideas and guidelines on how the development of tools can be further boosted to catch up with the rapid pace at which the field of membrane simulation progresses. This includes improving the compatibility between software tools and promoting the openness of the codes on which these applications rely.

An extended theoretical treatment is presented that includes the effects of internal dissipation within the bilayer. Within the length and time regimes appropriate to neutron spin-echo experiments, the results of Zilman and Granek are largely recovered, except that the bilayer curvature modulus kappa appearing in their theory must be replaced with an effective dynamic curvature modulus kappa =kappa+2d(2)k(m), where d is a distance comparable to the monolayer thickness (the height of the neutral surface from bilayer midplane) and k(m) is the monolayer compressibility modulus.

Despite of vast amount of accurate experimental data the atomistic resolution structures sampled by the glycerol backbone and choline headgroup in phoshatidylcholine bilayers are not known. Atomistic resolution molecular dynamics simulation model would automatically resolve the structures giving an interpretation of experimental results, if the model would reproduce the experimental data. In this work we compare the C-H bond vector order parameters for glycerol backbone and choline headgroup between 14 different atomistic resolution models and experiments in fully hydrated lipid bilayer. The current models are not accurately enough to resolve the structure. However, closer inspection of three best performing models (CHARMM36, GAFFlipid and MacRog) suggest that improvements in the sampled dihedral angle distributions would potentilly lead to the model which would resolve the structure. Despite of the inaccuracy in the fully hydrated structures, the response to the dehydration, i.e. P-N vector tilting more parallel to membrane normal, is qualitatively correct in all models. The CHARMM36 and MacRog models describe the interactions between lipids and cholesterol better than Berger/H$\backslash$"oltje model.

For this process, called backmapping or reverse transformation, several tools are available, but these commonly require libraries of molecule fragments or they are linked to a specific software package. In addition, the methods are usually restricted to specific molecules and to a specific force field. Here, we present an alternative method, consisting of geometric projection and subsequent force-field based relaxation. This method is designed to be simple and flexible, and offers a generic solution for resolution transformation. For simple systems, the conversion only requires a list of particle correspondences on the two levels of resolution. For special cases, such as nondefault protonation states of amino acids and virtual sites, a target particle list can be specified. The mapping uses simple building blocks, which list the particles on the di...},

abstract = {Accurate details on the sampled atomistic resolution structures of lipid bilayers can be experimentally obtained by measuring C–H bond order parameters, spin relaxation rates and scattering form factors. These parameters can be also directly calculated from the classical atomistic resolution molecular dynamics simulations (MD) and compared to the experimentally achieved results. This comparison measures the simulation model quality with respect to ‘reality'. If agreement is sufficient, the simulation model gives an atomistic structural interpretation of the acquired experimental data. Significant advance of MD models is made by jointly interpreting different experiments using the same structural model. Here we focus on phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers, which out of all model membranes have been studied mostly by experiments and simulations, leading to the largest available dataset. From the applied comparisons we conclude that the acyl chain region structure and rotational dynamics are generally well described in simulation models. Also changes with temperature, dehydration and cholesterol concentration are qualitatively correctly reproduced. However, the quality of the underlying atomistic resolution structural changes is uncertain. Even worse, when focusing on the lipid bilayer properties at the interfacial region, e.g. glycerol backbone and choline structures, and cation binding, many simulation models produce an inaccurate description of experimental data. Thus extreme care must be applied when simulations are applied to understand phenomena where the interfacial region plays a significant role.

abstract = {Local stress fields are routinely computed from molecular dynamics trajectories to understand the structure and mechanical properties of lipid bilayers. These calculations can be systematically understood with the Irving−Kirkwood−Noll theory. In identifying the stress tensor, a crucial step is the decomposition of the forces on the particles into pairwise contributions. However, such a decomposition is not unique in general, leading to an ambiguity in the definition of the stress tensor, particularly for multibody potentials. Furthermore, a theoretical treatment of constraints in local stress calculations has been lacking. Here, we present a new implementation of local stress calculations that systematically treats constraints and considers a privileged decomposition, the central force decomposition, that leads to a symmetric stress tensor by construction. We focus on biomembranes, although the methodology presented here is widely applicable. Our results show that some unphysical behavior obtained with previous implementations (e.g. nonconstant normal stress profiles along an isotropic bilayer in equilibrium) is a consequence of an improper treatment of constraints. Furthermore, other valid force decompositions produce significantly different stress profiles, particularly in the presence of dihedral potentials. Our methodology reveals the striking effect of unsaturations on the bilayer mechanics, missed by previous stress calculation implementations},

Our momentum conserving thermostat accounts for solvent-mediated momentum transfer by coupling coarse-grained degrees of freedom to stochastic continuum fields that account for both the solvent hydrodynamics and thermal fluctuations. We present both a general framework and specific methods to couple the particle and continuum degrees of freedom in a manner consistent with statistical mechanics and amenable to efficient computational simulation. For self-assembled vesicles, we study the diffusivity of lipids and their spatial correlations. We find the hydrodynamic coupling yields within the bilayer interesting correlations between diffusing lipids that manifest as a vortex-like structure similar to those observed in explicit-solvent simulations. We expect the introduced fluctuating hydrodynamics methods to provide a way to extend implicit-solvent models for use in a wide variety of dynamic studies.},

We conclude that the simplest explanation for the experimental and theoretical observations is that at mM concentrations the Na+ ions do not penetrate into bind to 1.Markus: 'penetrate into' gives the impression they go really deep, that is, even in the tails. On the other hand, 'bind to' could mean that they are bound just to the headgroup region. Should we maybe say precisely until where do they penetrate? phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers, in contrast to Ca2+. Further, the binding affinity of Na+ is overestimated in almost all molecular dynamics simulation models.

The crucial issue of the reliability of such simulations is the quality of the force field, and many efforts, especially in the latest several years, have been devoted to parametrization and optimization of the force fields for biomembrane modelling. In this review, we give account of the recent development in this area, covering different classes of force fields, principles of the force field parametrization, comparison of the force fields, and their experimental validation. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Biosimulations edited by Ilpo Vattulainen and Tomasz R{\'{o}}g.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) is a powerful tool for understanding the fluctuations of biomolecular systems. It is, however, subject to statistical errors in its sampling of the underlying distribution of states. One must understand these errors in order to draw meaningful conclusions from the simulation. This is becoming ever more critical as MD simulations of even larger systems are attempted. We present here a new method for determining the extent of convergence that relies on measures of the fluctuation space sampled by the simulation without any a priori knowledge of states or partitioning of the configuration space. This method reveals long correlation times, even for simple systems, and suggests caution when interpreting macromolecular simulations. We also compare this method with previous efforts to characterize the sampling of MD simulation.},

abstract = {A novel protocol has been developed for comparing the structural properties of lipid bilayers determined by simulation with those determined by diffraction experiments, which makes it possible to test critically the ability of molecular dynamics simulations to reproduce experimental data. This model-independent method consists of analyzing data from molecular dynamics bilayer simulations in the same way as experimental data by determining the structure factors of the system and, via Fourier reconstruction, the overall transbilayer scattering-density profiles. Multi-nanosecond molecular dynamics simulations of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer at 66{\%} RH (5.4 waters/lipid) were performed in the constant pressure and temperature ensemble using the united-atom GROMACS and the all-atom CHARMM22/27 force fields with the GROMACS and NAMD software packages, respectively. The quality of the simulated bilayer structures was evaluated by comparing simulation with experimental results for bilayer thickness, area/lipid, individual molecular-component distributions, continuous and discrete structure factors, and overall scattering-density profiles. Neither the GROMACS nor the CHARMM22/27 simulations reproduced experimental data within experimental error. The widths of the simulated terminal methyl distributions showed a particularly strong disagreement with the experimentally observed distributions. A comparison of the older CHARMM22 with the newer CHARMM27 force fields shows that significant progress is being made in the development of atomic force fields for describing lipid bilayer systems empirically. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

@article{Leonard2018,
abstract = {Long-range Lennard-Jones (LJ) interactions have a significant impact on the structural and thermodynamic properties of nonpolar systems. While several methods have been introduced for the treatment of long-range LJ interactions in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, increased accuracy and extended applicability is required for anisotropic systems such as lipid bilayers. The recently refined Lennard-Jones particle-mesh Ewald (LJ-PME) method extends the particle-mesh Ewald (PME) method to long-range LJ interactions and is suitable for use with anisotropic systems. Implementation of LJ-PME with the CHARMM36 (C36) additive and CHARMM Drude polarizable force fields improves agreement with experiment for density, isothermal compressibility, surface tension, viscosity, translational diffusion, and 13C T1 relaxation times of pure alkanes. Trends in the temperature dependence of the density and isothermal compressibility of hexadecane are also improved. While the C36 additive force field with LJ-PME remains a useful model for liquid alkanes, the Drude polarizable force field with LJ-PME is more accurate for nearly all quantities considered. LJ-PME is also preferable to the isotropic long-range correction for hexadecane because the molecular order extends to nearly 20 {\AA}, well beyond the usual 10–12 {\AA} cutoffs used in most simulations.},
